# Approaches to Writing

**Direct + Indirect = Business Messages**

## Direct Approach

* Used when sharing good, neutral, or some bad news.

```mermaid
graph LR
    i["Introduction (P)"] --> s[State main idea]
    bc["Body/Content (D)"]-->emi[Explain main idea]
    c["Conclusion (A)"] --> cc[Call to action <br> End with polite close]
```

## Indirect Approach

```mermaid
graph LR
    b["Buffer (B)"] --> ns[Neutral statements]
    d["Body/Content (D)"] --> emi["Explain main idea (provide reasoning/justification)"]
    p["Main Idea (P)"] --> smi[State main idea]
    a["Conclusion (A)"] --> cc[Call to action <br> End with polite close]
```

# Buffer

* Buffer is a neutral, noncontroversial statement that is closely related to the point of message.

## Attention of Writing Buffer

* Be neutral.
* Less than three short sentences.
* Don't imply a negative statement.

| Buffer                 | Neutral Statement                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explain Reasons        | 1. Provide relevant details. <br> 2. Highlight on important reasons/justification. <br> 3. Make sure the justification is clear to help the audience to accept the bad news.                                 |
| State or Imply Refusal | 1. State the bad news. <br> 2. De-emphasize on the bad news. <br> 3. Avoid over-apologizing.                                                                                                                 |
| Polite Close           | 1. Maintain a positive tone, instead of apologizing. <br> 2. Limit future correspondence. Encourage additional communication only if you are willing to discuss your decision further. <br> 3. End politely. |

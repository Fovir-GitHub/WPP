# The Four Cs of Communication

* Clarity
* Concision
* Coherence
* Continuity

## Clarity

* Focus on a specific message or goal at a time.
* Clarity in writing is established when the reader is aware of the author's statement of purpose.

## Concision

* Brief and simple.
* Use the fewest words necessary to convey ideas clearly.

### Importance

* The longer the text is, the less likely people are to read it.
* The wordier the text is, the more likely it is to confuse the readers.

### Improving Concision

* Use more specific words.
* Check to make sure that every word is contributing to the meaning of the sentence.
* Combine sentences.

## Coherence

* Coherence is achieved when sentences and ideas are connected and flow together smoothly.
* Coherence is a state or situation in which all the parts of ideas fit together well, so that they form a united whole.
* Allow readers to move easily throughout the text from one content to the next.

## Continuity

* Connect thoughts from sentence to sentence in order to stay on topic.

### Three Way to Do

* Transitional Phrases ("On the other hand", "not only ... but also")
* Conjunctions (as if, but, yet, while)
* Keywords (repeat words and phrases from the past sentence in the following sentence).
